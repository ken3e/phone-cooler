This is a phone cooler, which  was by 12years old me, this is just a battery and cooling fan connected together. It was my favorite project I have done, 
becuase I have been tinkering(making weird stuffs) since elementry 3th graders, this is the first project that I have tinkered with electronics. I had no
knowledge about electronics, and I had no thought then that how valuable things are. This thing was made from me, breaking down desktop for no reason, which 
worked with no problem, to get that ONE FAN from desktop. I still regret stupidity of me 3 years ago. However, this circuit is very very simple. There are two
parts, 1.5v batteries and cooling fan. I have connected three of 1.5v batteries in series to make 6v output. I have no idea how to buy things from internet then,
so I got bulky house light switch that i could get offline.
